// This is an assesment task from betson to perform at least two test on https://www.saucedemo.com

//THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED
Playwright with typescript was used to write this test and page object model(POM) was adopted
i created a folder name bestson nd installed playwright: using npm init playwright@latest
then i created a folder to store all my test named bestonui and used this as the testDir i.e test directory on the typscriptconfig file
i performed the two test on the login functionality and inventory
i created a page model for both the login and inventory which i named LoginPage and InventoryPage respectively
Then i went further to create a test file to run the test, i used index file to store all pages do as to avoid repetiton of imports
i perform three test cases for the login page one positive test and two negative tests respectively which the three test passed
Then i went further to perform three test for inventory as well in total 6 test ran and passed successully.
